# Blender-Based Tennis Ball Animation Rendering System

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a system that renders tennis ball animations in real-time through communication between the client and the Blender server. The client sends animation coordinate data to the server, and the server processes it to return 3D rendered images.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 System Components
- **Client Application**: Manages tennis ball trajectory data and displays rendered images
- **Server Application**: Processes rendering requests using Blender
- **Communication Module**: Handles data exchange between client and server
- **Rendering Engine**: Blender-based 3D rendering component
- **Data Management Module**: Stores and retrieves animation data

### 2.2 Data Flow
1. Client generates or loads tennis ball trajectory data
2. Trajectory data is transmitted to the server
3. Server processes the data with Blender
4. Rendered frames are returned to the client
5. Client displays the rendered animation

### 2.3 Communication Protocol
- WebSocket-based real-time communication
- JSON format for data exchange
- Binary data for image transfer
- Asynchronous request-response model

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Client Features
- Animation control (play, pause, speed adjustment)
- Camera angle control
- In/out determination visualization
- Frame-by-frame viewing
- Trajectory data loading and saving

### 3.2 Server Features
- Blender engine integration
- Multi-client support
- Queue-based request handling
- Optimized rendering configuration
- Scene and material management

### 3.3 Rendering Features
- Tennis court model with realistic textures
- Physics-based ball animation
- Dynamic lighting and shadows
- Multiple camera angle support
- High-quality image output

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **3D Rendering**: Blender Python API
- **Communication**: WebSockets
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL

### 4.2 Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Python Version**: 3.9+
- **Blender Version**: 3.0+
- **Development Tools**: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Real-time FPGA integration for ball tracking
- Machine learning for trajectory prediction
- VR/AR visualization support
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- Collaborative viewing for multiple users

Yes, I'll analyze the project documentation and establish a GUI development plan.

## 1. GUI Requirements Analysis

### Main Functional Requirements:
1. Tennis ball animation display
2. FPGA image analysis result display
3. Camera control (azimuth, elevation, distance)
4. Playback control (play, pause, stop, rewind)
5. LED visualization (in/out determination)
6. Instant replay

### Data Requirements:
1. Tennis ball trajectory data
2. FPGA analysis result
3. Camera view parameters
4. Current frame information

## 2. Interface Design

### Main Screen Layout:
1. Left panel: Control panel
   - Playback controls
   - Camera angle controls
   - Settings
2. Center area: View area
   - Top view: Tennis court top view with ball trajectory
   - 3D view: 3D rendered view of the tennis court and ball
3. Right panel: Information panel
   - Current frame data
   - Ball position information
   - FPGA analysis results
   - LED status display

### Control Components:
1. Playback slider: Control the current frame
2. Buttons: Play, pause, stop, forward, backward
3. Camera control sliders: Adjust azimuth, elevation, and distance
4. Speed control: Adjust playback speed (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x)

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic UI Framework
1. Set up Qt/PySide6 application structure
2. Implement main window layout
3. Create basic tab structure for different views
4. Implement frame display mechanism

### Phase 2: Playback Control Implementation
1. Develop timeline slider
2. Implement playback control buttons
3. Create frame rate and speed control
4. Implement frame navigation logic

### Phase 3: View Implementation
1. Develop 2D court view with trajectory
2. Implement 3D view rendering
3. Create camera control interface
4. Connect view updates to frame changes

### Phase 4: Data Integration
1. Implement frame data loading mechanism
2. Create data structures for analysis results
3. Develop integration with FPGA output
4. Implement real-time data update mechanism

### Phase 5: Final Features and Testing
1. Implement LED visualization
2. Add instant replay functionality
3. Create settings and configuration interface
4. Comprehensive testing and bug fixing

## 4. Technologies and Libraries

1. GUI Framework: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
2. Visualization: OpenGL, PyQtGraph
3. 3D Rendering: Blender API or custom renderer
4. Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
5. File Handling: JSON, HDF5

## 5. Timeline

- Week 1: Requirements analysis and design
- Week 2: Basic UI framework and playback controls
- Week 3: View implementation and camera controls
- Week 4: Data integration and FPGA connection
- Week 5: Final features, testing, and documentation

This development plan provides a structured approach to creating the GUI for the tennis ball animation system, ensuring all requirements are met while maintaining a modular and extensible design.
